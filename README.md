# Pollster

This is the second Dev Bootcamp Rails project building a basic polling app.

This was an introductory Rails project so there are no tests.

## Features

* No User accounts
  * Anyone can create polls.
* Admin and public links
  * Anyone with the admin link is able to edit polls and see their results.
  * The public link only gives users read-access to the questions and allows the users to submit answers.
